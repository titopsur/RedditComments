Ah ha 90's job titles

&gt;I quoted a flat fee for the job, assuming that it would be straightforward and that I had a good idea of what was required.

Oh fuck.

&gt;I didn't know what I was doing.

Indeed.</td></tr><tr><td>58</td><td colspan='2'>I'm not sure the work was a waste of time. Prudential came out of it with an application that tells people if there is an affiliate nearby. From a sales standpoint, this may be significantly better than offering a single number and saying, "Call us to find out if there's someone near you."</td></tr><tr><td colspan='3'><b>289 :: Solved by Flexbox: A showcase of problems once hard or impossible to s...</b></td></tr><tr><td>38</td><td colspan='2'>Can't wait to use this when IE10 is the new IE7!</td></tr><tr><td>35</td><td colspan='2'>Your device likely reports a different quantity of logical pixels, as it doesn't use them in quite the same way as a desktop.</td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td colspan='2'>&gt;And with Internet Explorer 11 and Safari 6.1 now in beta, Flexbox will soon be supported in every modern browser. 

A lot of things are made trivially easy in raw CSS when you disregard backward compatibility. I have client code targeting IE8 for Windows XP forfirksakes. How does this help me? It doesn't.</td></tr><tr><td colspan='3'><b>31 :: monoOne - a new monospace font for coding</b></td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td colspan='2'>Good for you, so why did you click something with "... a new **monospace** font ... " in the title?</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td colspan='2'>I had written about my decision to make it monospace in the readme:

&gt;this is the default for nearly all programming environments. Although there is some discussion if this specific feature is just historic ballast, the pro-monospace side argues that the possibility of lining up code and the resulting 2-dimensional structuring is useful. For me an even more substantial reason is that, in code, every character has potentially the same significance and should be given the same space to represent that. Giving every character the same amount of space facilitates reading on the character level and thus makes it easier to spot mistakes. &gt;Additionally it is a simple convention through all coding environments - the coder can be sure that her code will look similar for other programmers, even if they use another editor and typeface.

But i think it would be a debate on principles to discuss this here. </td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td colspan='2'>But does it handle cyrillic?</td></tr></table></html>
